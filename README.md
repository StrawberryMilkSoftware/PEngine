# PEngine
### The text-based Python game engine.

PEngine (Python Engine) is a **game engine built for text-based games.**

## How to use
To create a new project, run the `pengine.py` file.

`python3 pengine.py`

Enter a project name where the prompt says `Enter a project name: `.

Now, load the project.

`loadproject`

Enter the number of the project. The list should be similar to this:

```
All projects:
[1] AmazingGame
[2] BirdyFlap
[3] TestProject1
Enter a project number: 
```

Now, you are in your project and can use the `help` command at any time to use new commands.
Commands are intended to be user-friendly, so if not, make an issue in the [Issues page!](https://github.com/StrawberryMilkSoftware/PEngine/issues)

Thanks for choosing PEngine!
